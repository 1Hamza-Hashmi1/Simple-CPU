# Simple-CPU

## Project Description
Undertook project titled "Simple CPU" using Altera Quartus II and VHDL. During this project, designed and implemented a 16-bit RISC CPU on an FPGA. I led the design and implementation of key CPU components, including the program counter, register set, ALU, data memory module, datapath, and control unit. The project involved executing the VHDL design, simulation, and testing phases across multiple stages, ultimately culminating in the successful integration of the complete CPU system.
